        "Description": "Cards Against Humanity: Family Edition is a new party game that\u2019s just like Cards Against Humanity, except it\u2019s written for kids and adults to play together. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card. We didn\u2019t just take the adult stuff out of the original game: we wrote a whole new game from scratch and tested it with thousands of families. If you like to laugh at stuff like \u201cfilling my butt with spaghetti,\u201d this is the game for you. If you don\u2019t, go fill your butt with spaghetti!\n\nAlso includes:\nGlow in the Dark Box\nWritten By Kids Pack",
